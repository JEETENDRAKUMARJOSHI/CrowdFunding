# CrowdFunding
Crowdfunding is the use of small amounts of capital from a large number of individuals to finance a new business venture.

Anyone will be able to list his/her project for crowdfunding in smart contract. Create a function where each project will have unique Id. You can ask for some details like project name, expected cost, 
starting date, finishing date, etc while registering for particular project for crowdfunding. After registering for crowdfunding the contract owner will verify the details and validate it. Once owner 
has validated for the project, it is available for public to fund the project. Anyone can see the project details and ID accordingly they will transfer their funds from own wallet to the smart contract.

After the funding process is completed the particular project owner can withdraw his/her collected funds from smart contract.
